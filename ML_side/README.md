## Object Detection - Model Training

This folder is dedicated to the research, development, and implementation of the camera-based AI features. This component provides the "contextual awareness" for the device by handling complex tasks like object and text recognition.

**Purpose:** To handle complex tasks like object and text recognition.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Implementing AI models for object detection (e.g., identifying chairs, doors, bookshelves)
- Developing text recognition (OCR) functionalities
- Training and fine-tuning models on relevant datasets

**Note:** Our final prototype will utilize a camera for these functions. We are committed to ethical data handling practices, such as on-device processing, to protect user privacy.
