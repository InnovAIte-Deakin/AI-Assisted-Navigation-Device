# Documentation Folder

This folder contains all project-related documentation for the Capstone project.  
It serves as a structured archive for requirements, reports, and supporting materials, making it easy for the team and supervisors to access and review.  

**Contents include:**  
- Software Requirement Specification (SRS)  
- Expanded problem statement  
- User personas and user stories  
- Weekly stream updates and individual contributions  

The goal of this folder is to keep the documentation stream organized and aligned with the rest of the project.
