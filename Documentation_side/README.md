# Documentation Side

This folder contains all the work produced by the Documentation Stream.  
Our role is to keep the project organized, transparent, and easy to follow by maintaining clear records of requirements, personas, and weekly updates.  

**Purpose**  
The documentation stream provides a structured record of the project so that every stream can stay aligned and supervisors have a reliable source of information.  

**Responsibilities**  
- Writing and refining the Software Requirement Specification (SRS)  
- Expanding and updating the problem statement  
- Creating and maintaining user personas and user stories  
- Recording weekly progress and individual contributions  
- Organizing everything in GitHub for easy access and version control  

**Contents**  
- SRS drafts and final versions  
- User personas and user story documentation  
- Weekly updates and progress reports   

**Output**  
The documentation stream delivers a complete and organized set of project records that guide the entire lifecycle—from the first requirements to the final handover—while supporting all other streams in their work.
