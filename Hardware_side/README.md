## Sensors Side

This folder contains all the code and documentation for the low-level micro-controller that reads raw data from the physical sensors. This component is responsible for providing quick, real-time data for immediate obstacle avoidance.

**Purpose:** To acquire and pre-process data from various sensors (e.g., ultrasonic sensors, IMU module).

**Output:** Transmits processed sensor data to the `software_side` for higher-level analysis.
